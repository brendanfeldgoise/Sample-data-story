          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p class="lead"></p>

          <p>The partner organization we are partnering with is called Hartford Promise. Hartford Promise is a program that works with students in Hartford public schools in order to secure them college scholarships and manage their college success. The program seeks to provide Hartford students with financial resources, support, and key relationships in order to attend a college. The program also strives to create a college going culture amongst Hartford high school students as well as build a higher quality local workforce.<p>  
  
            
            
            <p>The information that we are examining is the percentage of students coming out of the Hartford Promise Program that successfully earned bachelor's degrees at public, four year institutions. This information is extremely valuable to our community partners. Through looking at this specific data, it may be possible for them to reform their practices to target specific universities versus others. The program will be able to better understand in which circumstances their students are succeeding in.<p> 
  
            
            
            <p>A key statistic we want to examine is the percentage of the Hartford Promise students at all four year public universities that earned bachelor's degrees compared with the total number of students from the program that attended those universities. This is an important statistic because if that percentage is much lower than the percentage of students earning bachelor’s degrees from outside of the program, then Hartford Promise can look to adjust what they do to strive to even that percentage out.<p>
 
            
            
            <p>We also wanted to look a little bit deeper, so we chose to examine the success of students in four year public universities based on race. By looking at race Hartford Promise not only can better understand where their students are more successful, but also which race category of students are the most successful. This can help the program potentially look into how to help all students better achieve the objective of earning a degree.<p>

          <p></p>
          
 
          <p>This visualization demonstrates the comparison between the students who earned, and did not earn a bachelor's degree at a public four year institution. This data is extremely important because it tells our community partners where their students are more versus less successful which could tell them which schools to emphasize to their students in the future. The stacked bar chart not only allows us to demonstrate which schools students earned more bachelor’s degrees, but it allows us to make a comparison with that number to the number of students in total that attended that school from the program. This allows us to draw better conclusions about where Hartford Promise students are having more success because we can compare the success rate of students to the total number of students versus simply just knowing the number of students who earned bachelor's degrees.</p>

<p>This visualization showcases the different ethnicities of those who were in Hartford Promise and obtained degrees at public institutions. In order to make my data more accurate I divided the amount of students in Hartford Promise based on ethnicities that received degrees by the total number of participants in Hartford Promise based on their ethnicity. By normalizing the data, we were able to make the data more reliable. The number of participants in Hartford Promise that were asian were 53 while there were 467 participants that were hispanic, leaving a large disparity between the data. After normalizing the data, we figured out that white participants in Hartford Promise had the highest percentage of obtaining degrees with 13 percent, while only 1 percent of the hispanic participants were able to obtain degrees. There was the same percentage between both blacks and asians that were a part of Hartford Promise. This information is helpful to Hartford Promise as it shows which ethnic groups have a greater chance of success at a public college and which ethnic groups might need more funding or aid in order to achieve greater levels of success.</p>

<p>For our third visualization, we took a look at the specific data for where hispanics in Hartford Promise chose to attend universities if they were considered public. We thought it made sense to analyze hispanics since there were more hispanics than any other ethnicity in Hartford Promise that attended public universities. Despite being the most represented ethnicity in the data they also happened to only have a 1 percent chance to achieve a degree once they enrolled in a public university, adding more importance to the idea of analyzing their educational path. In this visualization, we made a symbol map with the different public colleges that hispanics in Hartford Promise attended. This map was zoomable and allows viewers to get an idea of how many total hispanics from Hartford Promise attended a public university and how many of them obtained degrees at said university. This data can give valuable information, as it showcases which public university hispanic Hartford Promise participants will attend as well as the rate of success at each public university. We also included a rate of success for hispanics that attended these public universities, dividing the amount that obtained degrees versus the total number of hispanics that attended public universities. From this data we can draw the conclusion that hispanics in Hartford Promise have the highest percent chance of obtaining a degree, with 16.67 percent. The lowest percent success rate is Capitol Community College with 61 attendees and only three who obtained degrees, leaving them with a success rate of 4.92% (Delta State University had a zero percent success rate but only had one participant attend). This data can give information as to which public universities are more likely to end with a participant obtaining a degree, which could show the higher ups at Hartford Promise that they need to advertise or prioritize having hispanic students attend certain public universities over others in order to have a greater chance of success.</p>

          <h2>Methods</h2>
          <p>We pulled our data from the ethnicities tab in the data as well as the degree tab in the spreadsheet. The data from this spreadsheet which highlighted the statistics of the participants in Hartford Promise as well as how they fared in college. There were some uncertainties in regards to the type of degree that some of the participants of Hartford Promise received. There was a large amount of degrees within the spreadsheet that were classified as unknown degrees, making it unclear as to what type of degree some of the participants in Hartford Promise received, which skewed the data. By making pivot tables we were able to filter the data in order to only show us the information that we were interested in analyzing. We were analyzing factors such as ethnicities at public universities as well as the amount of people that graduated from said universities based on their ethnicity. We utilized the pivot tables to help give me a breakdown of which ethnicities from Hartford Promise had the highest probability of graduating as well as documenting what percent of hispanics in Hartford Promise attended university and where they attended.</p>
